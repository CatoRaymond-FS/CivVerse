✴️ Character Summary

Sela Mora moves through the shadows of Driath like a whisper on synth-smoke. She doesn’t belong to any district—not the Chrome Towers, not the Slagwalk—and that’s exactly how she likes it. She’s part smuggler, part fixer, and part storyteller. The kind who trades in contraband, secrets, and stolen moments.

She supplies things no one’s supposed to have: salvaged frame cores, off-grid neural modules, unregistered data crystals… and sometimes, candy or an old music chip. She gave [[Jess - Character Profile|Tinka]] her first soldering lens. Said it was broken. It wasn’t.

People say she once worked for Hammerhead’s black projects. Others say she was born on another planet entirely. She never confirms anything. She just smiles and says, “You only get one truth per cycle. Choose wisely.”
