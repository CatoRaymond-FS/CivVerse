# CivVerse
A Universe Built on Frames, Memory, and Movement


---

🌌 Overview

CivVerse is a connected universe spanning multiple worlds, each with its own identity, tech culture, and philosophical roots — but all touched in some way by the legacy of CivFrames: powerful exosuits originally built for survival, labor, and transformation. Some worlds thrive on them. Others abandoned them. Some have forgotten them altogether.

CivVerse is not about chosen heroes or great empires. It’s about the quiet struggle — the weight of survival, the ghosts in machines, and the question each person must answer:
What do you do with the frame you were given?

🧭 Themes

Legacy & Inheritance: Technology, trauma, and duty passed down.

Memory vs Reality: Forgotten histories. Filtered truths. Personal vs planetary memory.

Survival & Identity: CivFrames as both burden and liberation.

Connection & Disconnection: Between worlds, people, and pasts.

Mobility vs Stasis: Some fly between stars. Others can’t leave a single city block.

🧱 Core Concepts

🛠️ CivFrames

Exosuits used across various worlds for work, repair, transport, or conflict.

Some are mass-produced. Others are legacy relics maintained by individuals.

Models vary drastically: from Lyra’s Model 008 repair frame to experimental battlefield Frames lost to time.


🌍 Worlds

Each world is self-contained in tone, culture, and tech level — but threads of shared tech, memory, and ideology connect them.

[[Unira]]: A harsh, industrial planet where CivFrames are lifelines. Deep class divisions, survivalism, and underground resistance.

[[Caelus]]: A pristine world of learning, sky gardens, and orbital travel. Frames are background tech; the focus is knowledge and navigation.

(More worlds coming...)


🧬 The Divide

Most citizens don't know the full history of CivFrames — or even the truth of their own planet’s past.
Access to information is filtered by status, system, or world of origin. Some cities archive it, some bury it, and some worship it.

📖 Narrative Threads

> These can emerge across characters, games, or stories in the CivVerse:



A mechanic haunted by the death of her father keeps a frame running just to feel him nearby.

A former pilot expelled for smuggling learns what it means to stay grounded — or fly for someone else.

A scavenger uncovers a forgotten Frame that talks back.

A planet that believes it was the first to build the Frames — and another that remembers differently.
