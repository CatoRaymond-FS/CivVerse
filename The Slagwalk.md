One of the most undesirable locations in [[Driath and Driath's End|Driath]], The Slagwalk is where the shady thrive and hope goes to die. It isn’t a district so much as a sprawling, rust-bitten tangle of alleyways, sagging tenements, pop-up stalls, and flickering neon signs that never quite work right.

If anything good comes out of the Slagwalk, it’s the same two things that’ve always survived down here: a strong drink and a story worth regretting.

This isn’t the place for a stroll or a friendly meet-up. It’s a place where favors are traded in silence, where half-built machines hiss and spark from corners, and where everyone’s either hiding something or hiding from someone. The bars here run cheap, hot, and mean. The repair shops never close—but you’re as likely to get shorted as you are serviced.

The real draw? The vices. Chems, bootleg stim-flicks, contraband exosuit mods, off-grid neural jacks—if it’s illegal or almost illegal, someone here’s selling it. And someone else is watching.

Children, though rare, survive here as small ghosts—quick, clever, and barely noticed. They don’t play so much as tinker. Survivors like [[Jess - Character Profile|Tinka]] use discarded processors and busted drones to build toys, alarms, or strange little devices that hum with forgotten life.

The air? Unbreathable without filtration if you linger too long. The sky overhead is a permanent shroud of haze, smogged out by runoff from The Chrome Towers and the endless freight convoys from the Freight Spine.

But on some nights—rare, fleeting nights—if you're lucky, and you know which scaffold to climb, and you time it just right, you might catch a glimpse of the real sky.
A patch of stars. A slice of moon. Enough to remind you the world above isn’t just myth.

And then it’s gone again.
Just like the people who dream too hard down here.
