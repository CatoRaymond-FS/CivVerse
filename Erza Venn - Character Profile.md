✴️ Character Summary

Ezra Venn is the clean face of a dirty machine. Handsome, confident, and always smiling, he wears his Hammerhead badge like armor and speaks like every word is a company slogan. To most, he’s a harmless bureaucrat—strict but fair. But [[Lyra - Character Profile|Lyra]] knows better. Beneath that designer synth-suit is a cold strategist who plays workers like parts in a machine.

He believes in the system. He thinks suffering is the price of order. And he never gets his hands dirty—he just writes the policies that do the damage.

Ezra is deeply entrenched in the affairs of [[The Slagwalk]], but only from a distance. He signs off on ration limits, sets shift productivity quotas, and enforces “worker performance assessments.” To him, it’s all clean numbers. He never hears the coughing in the mines.

Lately, he’s noticed [[Jess - Character Profile|Jess]]. Not in a kind way. He thinks she’s valuable—trainable. “Salvageable,” he once wrote in a memo [[Lyra - Character Profile|Lyra]] wasn’t supposed to see.
