The more I write, the more I see;
The more I pray, the clearer grows my soul.
I behold myself in every moment, in every breath given,
And all creation breathes with grace, a spark divine.

Words arise and shape the world;
They teach me what was hidden deep within.
They reveal the fears I held,
And deliver me unto peace.

In my heart I find healing, truth, and rest;
A sanctuary of belonging and understanding.
Behold, I am both the maker and the made,
In the quiet stillness, my spirit is known.
