### 💬 Signature Phrase:

### 🗺️ Background:
Noryx wasn’t born to be a guardian. His father was a respected elder, and Noryx had trained as a swiftfoot scout, known for navigating the [[Crownwood Forests]] by instinct alone. But on the night of **The First Golden Moment**, when Lior was born and the skies cracked with amber light, his father called him back from the wilds.

With no ceremony, only a grave look and a quiet blessing, he gave Noryx a task:  
> *“Walk with the boy. Guard the fire. You’ll understand when the stars fall again.”*

Since then, Noryx has followed Lior across the **Goldenfields**, through **The Horizon Spires**, and into the dreaming woods. He doesn’t fully understand the child’s connection to the planet — but he believes. And when belief wavers, he remembers the feeling in the wind that night: *Aurelya breathing.*
