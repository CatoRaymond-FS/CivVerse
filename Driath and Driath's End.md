🏙️ City Overview 
Driath is a vertically layered industrial city marked by extreme class division. One of the worst cases in [[Unira|Unira]]. The separation between rich and poor is not maintained by walls or guards, but by social fear, control, and systemic conditioning. Poorer districts sprawl outward in decaying townhouses and apartments. Richer areas rise into gleaming skyscrapers above the smog line. Driath’s End, a mining and mechanical zone, exists far below the city—populated by the forgotten, the workers, and the lost.

🗺️ Districts  
  
[[The Slagwalk]]: A chaotic slum of tangled alleys, bars, repair shops, and open stalls. Not a social space—more like a slow collapse.  
  
[[The Surface Gate]]: Entry point to the underground mines. Guarded, fortified, rusted. Covered in propaganda and graffiti.  
  
[[The Chrome Towers]]: Skyscrapers where the elite live in luxury, high above the polluted skies. Remote and removed.  
  
[[The Freight Spine ]]: Industrial transport and shipping center for mined goods.

⚖️ Social Stratification
Class divide is total. The wealthy live in the towers and rarely—if ever—see the surface. The poor stay low. The poor fear Hammerhead Engineering and corrupt officials. The elite don’t fear anything—they’re protected and misinformed. Social mobility exists in theory, through bribes or rare innovation, but in reality, most are born into their place. The mayor serves as a symbolic leader, but true control belongs to Hammerhead.

🛠️ Culture & Daily Life  
  
In the Slagwalk: No central gathering spots—just bars, alleys, broken games, and fading hobbies. Adults drink or tinker to survive; children play with scraps and broken devices. Hope exists only in rumors and myths—like glimpses of the true sky.  
  
In the Towers: Life is fully automated—climate control, AI assistants, immersive VR. Elites are unaware of the suffering below. They believe the system is fair because they receive filtered reports and training programs. Fashion is synthetic, translucent, and curated by aesthetic AI. Some wear symbolic exosuit-style jackets—never knowing the cost of the real thing.

🌫️ Sky and Mobility 
The sky in Driath is almost always choked with haze and smog, especially in the lower districts. Hidden spots exist where the true sky can be seen—forgotten rooftops, scaffolded climbs, abandoned towers. Most people never leave Driath due to poverty, fear, and systemic control. The illusion of choice maintains the divide. The higher you live, the more it seems like people choose to stay poor.
