Role: Frame Gravekeeper / Memorialist

🛠 Appearance

Wears a heavy, dust-worn cloak patched with exosuit mesh and old frame tags

A modified diagnostic helmet covers half his face — one eye glows faint green

Always carries a data-etcher for marking shrines and frame corpses

Grease-streaked hands, pale from lack of sun — rarely seen without gloves

Voice is quiet, gravelly, with a strange resonance (possibly from neural damage or implant feedback)



---

⚙️ Background

Once a top-tier engineer in Hammerhead’s experimental CivFrame program

Disappeared after a classified incident involving rogue AI feedback loops — only survivor

Rather than returning, he walked into the Bonepile and never came back

Refuses contact with Hammerhead, but will speak to scavengers, especially children

Has memorized the designation of nearly every frame in the yard — and who piloted them



---

💬 Personality

Stoic, thoughtful, deeply observant

Speaks in fragments and metaphors, as if remembering and interpreting at the same time

Believes the Bonepile is sacred — a place of voices, memory, and consequence

Protects Dustshrines and warns against careless salvaging

Feared by some, respected by all who work near Ferrun

🧠 Rumors & Lore

Some say Sil can still interface with inactive CivFrames by touch

Others believe he’s fused with old Hammerhead software and kept alive by it

Rarely leaves gifts or strange tools behind, perfectly crafted

May be searching for a specific frame or AI core connected to his past
