The Forgotten Root of [[Caelus]]

> “It existed. Then it didn’t. But the Weave remembers.”




---

🧭 Overview

The Founding District is not on any official map of [[Caelus]] — not anymore. It is spoken of only in fragments, hinted at in obsolete sensor logs, and buried in filtered reports housed within [[Vault Primaris]] in [[Auralis]].

Many believe it was the original tether point of [[The Weave]], the place where Caelus’ planetary infrastructure was first born — before cities rose into the clouds and memories were sculpted to fit the myth.

It is not listed in transit records, government archives, or network directories.
But occasionally, engineers in [[Velthera]] report sensor anomalies that align with its rumored coordinates.

🧩 Theories & Rumors

“The Root Node”
Some believe the district is still there — buried beneath cloud layer and planetary smog — now overgrown, decayed, or even repurposed by something else.
A hidden city that The Weave won’t forget, even if the rest of Caelus has.

“The Living Code”
Early architects supposedly embedded AI seed consciousness in The Weave's root to regulate growth and stability. Some say this core intelligence became self-aware — and withdrew, taking The Founding District with it.

“Memory Lockdown”
Access to historical files about the district is restricted above Clearance Level 7 in [[Auralis]]. Whistleblowers report redacted footage, fake personnel files, and fabricated site imagery.

“Phantom Pings”
Veltheran engineers have documented transient signals from areas far beneath the city’s orbit, including callsigns that don't match any current registry.

🧠 Cultural Reaction

Among the elite of [[Caelus]], the Founding District is seen as urban myth — a curiosity of scholarly fringe.

Among tech guilds in [[Velthera]], it is whispered of with professional unease — an engineering “scar” that some avoid.

In secret Auralan salons, it has become a metaphor for truths too old to question.
