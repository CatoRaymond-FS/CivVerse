🏙️ Overview

At the intellectual heart of [[Velthera]], Clarity Square functions as a meticulously designed civic and residential zone. This is where Caelus houses its engineers, specialists, and data-shielded thinkers — minds trusted with maintaining societal transparency and technological advancement.

Clean, symmetrical, and almost too perfect, the Square is where truth is sculpted into habit. Not just a place for living — a place for living correctly.
