🧠 Personality & Inner Life

Charming but guarded — always two thoughts ahead

Doesn’t trust authority but knows how to speak their language

Disillusioned by Caelan ideals of order and truth

Follows his own moral compass — which mostly points to Luna, his partner

Enjoys the quiet of zero-gravity calibration bays — it’s the only time his mind slows down

A collector of contraband music and archived starlogs

Never forgot the thrill of simulated spaceflight — the silence, the drift

💬 Relationships

[[Luna - Character Profile|Luna]] - A talented pilot, his girlfriend and partner in life. She’s the reason he hasn’t left Caelus entirely.

Supervisors at Spindle Gate – Know he’s smart, and quietly monitor him. He’s valuable but on thin ice.

Launch Clients – Often off-worlders, fringe scientists, or unknown identities with encrypted creds.

🔧 Daily Routine

Begins work calibrating thrust vector systems and nav-mapping arrays

Often lingers after-hours near unused launch pads

Encrypts launch paths for Luna’s flights in secret

Writes short starfield maps by hand — a fading habit from school

Occasionally runs diagnostics on ships that shouldn’t exist in the CTA registry



---

🌌 Symbolic Object

Keeps a cracked flight helmet visor in his locker — the one he used during his final training sim

The crack appeared after he refused to abort a test run to help a malfunctioning wingmate

A reminder: he can still fly — just not legally



---

🔐 Internal Conflict

Knows he’s being watched. Doesn’t care. But if Luna got caught, he would fold

Still dreams of open space — the real kind — even if he claims he’s done with it

Hates that Caelus feels like a cage wrapped in silk

Thinks about disappearing. Doesn’t because she’s still here

Some nights he sees repeat signal IDs — and they don’t match anything from his system logs
