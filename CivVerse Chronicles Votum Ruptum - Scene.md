## Scene – The Forest, the Ship, and the Boy  
*The Knight’s Turning Point*

---

**Region:** Restricted Woodland Zone, near Citadel borders  
**Time:** Dusk  
**Characters:**  
- **Knight-Pilgrim** (18–19 years old, Viridic Order)

### ⛰️ Exterior – Cracked Forest Ridge

Dry winds stir ash and dust through the forest’s edge. The Knight-Pilgrim, armored in the green and gold of the **Viridic Order**, walks alone — blade strapped across his back, eyes alert.

His pilgrimage brought him here — to silence, to isolation, to clarity.

But something’s wrong.

He kneels. Below him, deep in the woods:

A **ship**.  
Hidden beneath collapsed branches and overgrown brush.  
Not native.  
**Unauthorized.**

He descends.

### 🌲 Interior – The Ship’s Perimeter

Near the base of the overgrown craft, he hears **scratching**.

Steel-silent, the knight draws his blade, moving closer.

He rounds the corner.

A **boy** sits cross-legged in the dirt beside the ship — dark hair, ink-stained fingers, scribbling into a thick **journal**.

No guards. No weapons.

Just words.

> **R.C. FAYE**  
> _(softly)_  
> “You can read it, if you want.”

The knight’s grip tightens. But slowly… he kneels.  
Curiosity overwhelms training.

The boy flips to a page.  
Hands it over.

### 📖 INSERT – *The Poem: “But I Can Say This”*

> I do not know the name of the one who is to come.  
> I do not know what color his eyes will be,  
> or what weight his steps will carry.  
> I do not know the hour of his rising  
> nor the shape of his voice in the morning.

> I do not know how he will bleed  
> or if the world will deserve him.  
> I do not know if I will see him —  
> only that something in the marrow of time  
> leans toward him like the sky to the sea.

> But I can say this:

> He will be known by the stillness in his wake.  
> Where others rush to conquer, he will linger.  
> Where others build monuments, he will plant.  
> Where others speak to be heard,  
> he will listen so the silence may sing.

> Light remembers him.  
> And so —  
> I will too.

### 🌘 Moment – A Presence Appears

A **soft wind**.  
The forest hushes.

From behind — a **figure** steps through the brush:

**VERE.**  
Unaged. Ageless. Dressed plainly, standing effortlessly.

> **VERE**  
> “He never stopped writing. Not really.”  
> _(a beat)_  
> “It’s time to go.”

The boy closes the journal and rises.

He turns to the knight.

> **R.C. FAYE**  
> _(quietly)_  
> “Thank you. For reading.”

Then he follows Vere into the woods.

No explanation.

No apology.

Just **truth** that walks like shadow.

### 🌒 Exterior – Forest Ridge, Later

The knight stands again at the ridge, overlooking the hidden ship.

The page is gone. The silence remains.

For the first time in his life—

He feels **unmoored**.

> *He had come to find heresy.*  
> *Instead, he found something holy.*
