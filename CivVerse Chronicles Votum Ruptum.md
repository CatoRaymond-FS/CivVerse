## 🏛️ Society & Rule

### The Viridic Order
- **Core Faction**: Religious-martial theocracy.
- **Leader**: An ancient line of high clerics and general-inquisitors.
- **Faith**: Centered on a savior-emperor named **Virgil**, who "ascended" after bringing unity.
- **Doctrine**: "Salvation comes through obedience and struggle."
- **Technology**: Advanced but selectively used; offworld tech is tightly controlled.

## ⚔️ The Knights

- **Role**: Enforcers of the Order; defenders of the faith.
- **Appearance**: Clad in stylized armor, with tech embedded subtly—energy blades, shock-absorbing plating.

- **Faithful Service**: Expected to destroy heresy without question.

## 🛐 The Heresy & Prophecy

- **Rumor**: Whispers of a **boy born under a bright sky**, destined to bring peace to all who near him.
- **Contradiction**: Opposes the faith's doctrine that salvation has already come through Virgil.

- **Effect**: Causes unrest among the people and questioning among younger knights.

- **Citadels**: Tall, walled bastions for the Order’s elite and leadership.
- **Villages**: Simple, spiritual communities; closely watched.
- **Law**: Heresy is death — no exiles, no trials.

## 🎵 Theme Song

### “Votum Ruptum” — *"A Broken Vow"*

**Genre**: Neoclassical Darkwave / Post-Classical hybrid  
**Mood**: Sacred, mournful, revolutionary  
**Language**: English with Latin potential  
**Lyrics**:  

> I believed in the light, in your words,  
> But the light fled, and shadow remains.  
> In the ash, my heart still beats—  
> A broken vow... that is me.  
>   
> We were knights, but we fell—  
> Not in battle, but in faith.  
> Silence speaks the truth now,  
> And peace is not in obedience.  
>   
> I heard a voice in the night wind,  
> Not from the throne, but from the earth.  
> And a boy came beneath a burning sky—  
> His eyes... are not our light.  
>   
> Fire does not cleanse, only consumes,  
> And your law is a sword without mercy.  
> If loving the truth is heresy,  
> Then I will be a heretic.  
>   
> *(softly)*  
> A broken vow.  
> An open heart.  
> The truth... lives.
