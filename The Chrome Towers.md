Rising far above the soot and noise of the city, The Chrome Towers pierce the hazy skyline like polished needles of wealth and ignorance. Gleaming spires of reinforced glass and alloy, they reflect the light from distant suns—even if they never feel it directly.

Here, the air is filtered, the temperature regulated, and the silence curated. The towers are home to Driath’s wealthiest citizens—executives, heirs, inventors, and influencers who’ve never set foot below Tier 5. They live high enough that the pollution is someone else’s problem. So is poverty. So is death.

Inside, each level of a Chrome Tower is its own private world—sealed habitats with smart-fabric furniture, AI-curated moods, and simulation pods that can show you any reality except the one just below your feet. Meals are printed. Clothes are grown. And relationships are managed by algorithmic suggestion. It’s a society built on illusion, performance, and status—with just enough innovation to distract from the truth.

Residents believe in upward mobility because they’re told it exists. Every public feed is filled with sanitized interviews, success stories, and holograms of “model workers” being rewarded for loyalty. They don’t know what life in [[The Slagwalk]] looks like.
They’ve never smelled burning rubber or heard a scream in the mines.

Some of them even wear stylized exosuit jackets—a nod to the rugged labor class they’ve never met. Fashionable. Iconic. Meaningless.

At the topmost spires, the towers taper into private domes. Gardens grow under UV mimic lights. Pools reflect false skies. Stars are projected across ceilings so no one has to look down.

And why would they?
Everything beneath them is already owned.
