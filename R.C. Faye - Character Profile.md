Introspective, charismatic, and reserved — a mind that moves three steps ahead.

His silence unnerves some; his words, when spoken, carry philosophical weight.

Considered unshakable — serene in chaos, detached but never indifferent.

Seen as a paradox: aloof but protective, stoic but deeply feeling.

Challenges the institutions of Caelus but remains part of them — by necessity or fate.

💠 Relationship to Lyra

[[Lyra - Character Profile|Lyra]] and Faye are mirrors — not in circumstance, but in soul.

She lives beneath the earth; he dwells among stars and thought.

They both suffer, both endure, both refuse to break — and both are slowly thawing.

Though they’ve never met, dreams and patterns ripple between them.

Perhaps their fates are entangled, across worlds.
