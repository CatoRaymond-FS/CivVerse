Appearance

A 13-year-old boy stands alone beneath a twilight sky, his silhouette outlined by fading starlight. His expression is serious, eyes sharp with storm-grey intensity. He wears a tattered ceremonial cloak draped over one shoulder, its spiral crest barely visible through wear and dust. Shoulder-length black hair falls in uneven braids, tied with dull silver thread. His robes are layered and ragged, a mix of dark violet and ash tones, cinched at the waist with simple leather.

Faint golden tattoos shimmer faintly across his collarbones — remnants of a broken prophecy. His skin is dusted olive-gold, sun-worn but youthful. He stands barefoot on cracked earth, a carved stone totem held loosely in his hand. Though young, he carries the weight of someone who was almost everything. The wind brushes past him, but he doesn’t flinch. The sky behind him is quiet, as if holding its breath. He does not smile.

Personality

Stoic and watchful — speaks little, thinks deeply

Burdened but proud — still walks like someone once believed in

Carries quiet resentment — not against Lior, but against silence

Seeks meaning — not through power, but through understanding

Secretly yearns — not for a crown, but for proof he still matters

Backstory

Born beneath a red moon and foretold by three generations of seers, Auren was raised to fulfill the “Flame-Born Mandate” — a prophecy whispered across the spires and shrines of the Prophet clans. From the time he could walk, he was trained in rites, taught the sacred stories, and made to believe that the very breath of Aurelya moved through him.

When he was five, a boy named Lior was born under golden skies.

There were no questions. No need for proof. The elders stopped reciting Auren’s name. His tattoos dimmed. The ceremonial offerings ceased. He was quietly sent away, kept within the tribe but no longer at its heart.

Now, at thirteen, Auren wanders. He studies old ruins, listens to dying winds, and carries his broken totem not as a weapon, but as a question.

He has seen Lior from afar — twice. He does not hate him.

But something aches inside him whenever the golden light returns.
