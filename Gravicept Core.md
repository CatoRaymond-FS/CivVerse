⚙️ Overview

Hidden beneath the structured calm of [[Velthera]], The Gravicept Core is the silent engine of Caelus' physical integrity. It houses the city’s gravitational and kinetic stabilization systems — regulating everything from building equilibrium to inter-city drift alignment.

This is where the laws of motion are rewritten to serve civilization. And where no one without clearance should ever tread.

🛠️ Structure & Function

Core Functions:

Gravitational Modulation Arrays — balance citizen weight distribution and building load

Kinetic Dampening Coils — prevent tremors from transit lines and atmospheric variance

Drift Realignment Nodes — stabilize the tethered city network of [[Caelus]]


Environmental Design:

Deep tunnels, echo-dampened maintenance shafts, and cold, low-oxygen chambers

LED-laced floor paths light up only with authorization

Nearly all operations are handled by autonomous calibration drones and AI relays

🚫 Security Protocol

Access: Strictly limited to a handful of gravitech engineers and authorized AI-calibration personnel

Lockout Clause:

All unauthorized access triggers full AI lockdown

Communications black out, field suppression activates, and doors become sealed kinetic barriers


Override Pathways: Require multi-keyed biometric data and a signed tri-AI consensus


> “It’s not just a system. It’s a doctrine: balance without exception.”
