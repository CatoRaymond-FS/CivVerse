📘 Overview
The Radiant Assembly is a sprawling open-air amphitheater and intellectual crucible at the heart of [[Auralis]]. Ringed by kinetic glass towers and echo-tuned wind spires, it serves as the ideological epicenter of [[Caelus]] — a place where public debate, ethical discourse, and philosophical policy-making take the stage. Though noble in design, the Assembly is often more about controlled performance than genuine dissent.

🏛️ Purpose and Structure
The Assembly was founded during the post-Founding expansion of Caelus as a way to decentralize lawmaking from automated systems and reinfuse ethics into public governance. It operates as both a legal chamber and cultural institution, with debates held weekly and resolutions passed through collective discourse rather than votes.

Its concentric ring design places invited speakers in the Core Stage, with secondary rings reserved for credentialed observers, students, and AI discourse engines. Higher-tier citizens sit in elevated galleries, often serving more as patrons than participants.

A tiered voice-access system controls who can speak, and for how long, managed by “Solemn,” the sector’s resident speech-regulation AI.

🎭 Culture
Being chosen to speak at The Radiant Assembly is considered a mark of profound intellectual respect. Speakers often wear traditional reactive robes that change hue and pulse rate with emotional tone — blending art, ethics, and personal presentation.

Discourse is elevated, stylized, and steeped in tradition. Many debates are choreographed like performances, with rhythmic speaking, tonal modulation, and visual metaphors.

Despite the grandeur, there’s quiet cynicism among the lower tiers — many view the Assembly as a stage for rehearsed policy, where true decisions are made elsewhere.
