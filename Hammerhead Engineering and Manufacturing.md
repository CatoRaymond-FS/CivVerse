🏢 Overview

Name: Hammerhead Engineering and Manufacturing
Alias: HEM
Founded: Several generations ago during early urban expansion on [[Unira]]
Headquarters: Unknown – operates through distributed sectors and city-level divisions
Primary Function: Manufacture, deployment, and maintenance of [[CivFrame]] units and infrastructure for mining, transport, and construction
Presence: Dominant in cities like [[Driath and Driath’s End|Driath]], especially areas such as the [[The Surface Gate]], [[Driath and Driath's End]]etc.

🛠️ Purpose & Function

HEM serves as both a civilian employer and a pseudo-governmental power within much of Unira’s industrial zones. While publicly known for innovation in engineering, they also act as the enforcing hand of corporate control across city infrastructure.

Their products include:

CivFrame Models - exosuits used for labor, repair, logistics

Mass mining systems

Transport freight calibration tools

Environmental regulation systems

Surveillance architecture embedded in infrastructure

🧱 Organizational Structure

Executive Board (Location Unknown): Makes planetary directives. Never seen publicly.

Regional Directors: Corporate elite assigned to oversee cities like [[Driath and Driath's End|Driath]]rarely appear in person.

Local Admin Cells: Corrupt and profit-driven; they manage districts like the [[The Surface Gate]] and [[The Freight Spine]]. 

Onsite Supervisors: Harsh, pragmatic. Interface directly with workers like [[Lyra - Character Profile]]. 

Technician Classes: The labor force—mechanics, welders, calibrators, and engineers. Treated as expendable.

Scout Division (rumored): A hidden department focused on recovering lost technology and investigating frame-related anomalies.

📦 Key Facilities

HEM Armature Yards: Where CivFrames are repaired, disassembled, or reassigned

Control Towers: Oversee movement of freight, power supply, and worker logs

Frame Foundries: Forge and test new exosuits and proprietary tools

Surface Gate Command Posts: Serve as intake areas and disciplinary offices

Underground Relay Stations: Used to monitor deep activity — and possibly rumors of strange readings too deep for comfort



---

👁️ Culture & Worker Life

Mantra: “Precision. Power. Progress.”

Work Environment: Grueling, repetitive, and high-risk.

Safety Protocols: Exist primarily to limit liability, not to protect.

Innovation Philosophy: Fail fast, repurpose, move forward.

Worker Belief: HEM owns you once you sign on. Promotions are nearly impossible without bribery, brilliance, or accident-induced vacancy.


In places like [[The Slagwalk]], HEM is synonymous with fear and stagnation. But in elite circles, they’re praised for their “commitment to planetary advancement.”
