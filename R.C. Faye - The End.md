🌒 The Truth: The Laughing Cell

The cold air of the Caelan prison was thin and still, humming with the low static of surveillance. Deep beneath the silver towers and crystal pathways of Caelus, [[R.C. Faye - Character Profile| Dr. Faye]] sat cross-legged in his cell—quiet, unmoving.

His hands were bruised. His coat was gone. There was a long scrape along his cheekbone where the helmet had cracked against his face during the struggle. But he didn’t feel it anymore. He just sat there… eyes closed.

And then—he laughed.

Not a dry laugh, not hollow. Something full. Light. Like someone remembering something kind. The guards outside exchanged glances. They didn't understand.

But R.C. did.

He had bought Vere enough time. They were free—he felt it in his chest like the sun rising behind his ribs. The plan had worked. It had to. Somewhere, light was filtering through treetop canopies again. Somewhere, they were holding hands in a new dawn. Somewhere, Aurelya was safe.

He leaned back against the metal wall and tilted his head to the ceiling, his eyes glimmering.

“…Golden, isn’t it?” he whispered.

And for a moment, in his mind, he saw the sun bleeding through a field of wheat. A crown of leaves. Amber eyes. [[Lioranthros Solen - Character Profile|A Boy]], smiling.


☀️ The What If: The Crown Walks Beside Him

R.C. Faye stood barefoot in the amber grass, the sunlight so thick it tasted like honey on the air. Aurelya breathed softly around him—flowers turning in slow rhythm, the trees alive with quiet song.

And there he was.

Lioranthros Solen stood at the top of a soft hill, arms outstretched like wings, his crown of vines shimmering with dew. He turned, smiling, and ran toward R.C., laughter ringing like a bell.

R.C. dropped to one knee as the boy neared, overwhelmed—not by grief, not by pain—but by peace. By awe. He opened his arms, and Lior crashed into them, hugging him like they’d known each other forever.

"You made it," Lior whispered, pulling back.

"I don’t know how," R.C. said, voice trembling.

"You chose to live," Lior replied simply. “Not just to survive. But to live.”

They walked side by side through golden fields, their shadows long behind them. No fear. No war. Just a boy and a man and the great, warm sky overhead. No title. No Frame. No weight.

Just the now.

R.C. turned to Lior. “What do I do now?”

And Lior, looking up with all the wisdom of the universe in his eyes, smiled.

“Be free.”
