📘 Overview
Vault Primaris stands like a silent obelisk near the edge of [[The Radiant Assembly]], reflecting the filtered Caelan sunlight in seamless panels of mirrorstone. It is the central archival institution of [[Caelus]], a place where history, science, and ideological narratives are preserved — and, some say, quietly rewritten. Though it presents itself as a public knowledge center, access is strictly hierarchical, and deeper levels remain tightly controlled.

🏛️ Purpose and Structure
Vault Primaris was designed to house the full intellectual and historical legacy of Caelus. It curates and safeguards planetary records, from political declarations and civic transcripts to quantum simulations, genetic archives, and extinct cultural artifacts.

The vault is split into access tiers:

Tier 1 – General public, heavily curated content

Tier 2 – Verified scholars and researchers

Tier 3 – Government and institutional historians

Tier 4 – Unknown; exists only by rumor


Entry to higher levels is governed by “Nomen,” the archival AI. Access is determined by alignment testing — a mixture of psychological vetting, rhetorical calibration, and ideological loyalty scoring.

Its internal layout is vertical: upper floors contain libraries and observatories, while lower floors extend deep underground into secure data vaults and memory cryospheres.

🏗️ Key Facilities

The Living Index: A reactive display archive that shifts content based on who is present. No two researchers experience the same version of history.

The White Chamber: A meditation hall where scholars reflect before delving into contentious records.

Echo Wing: Reserved for cultural memory — oral histories, music, emotion-mapped art, and extinct dialects.

Subvault Delta (rumored): Believed to contain forbidden logs about [[The Founding District]] and the origins of planetary influence.

🎭 Culture
Vault Primaris is shrouded in an atmosphere of silent reverence. Scholars speak in low tones, and emotional expression is regulated by embedded ambient fields designed to encourage focus and reduce dissent.

Working in the vault is considered a privilege, though many archivists suffer from “truth fatigue” — a kind of psychological erosion caused by reconciling official narratives with the fragments they discover deeper down.

There’s a whispered phrase among researchers: “What you read in Vault Primaris stays in Vault Primaris — or you don’t read again.”
