Overview

Aurelya is a primal, radiant world, a planet of golden plains, endless bloom, and deep natural memory. It is beautiful and wild, alive in ways most worlds have forgotten how to be. The wind hums. The trees whisper. The dirt remembers.

It does not want to be conquered.
It does not want to be saved.
It simply is — vibrant, untamed, watching.

The planet has actively rejected colonization attempts, especially those led by extractive megacorps like Hammerhead. Tech malfunctions here, Frames are torn apart by wildlife, and entire outposts have vanished overnight beneath a thicket of roots or a field of flowers that wasn't there the day before.

Planetary Traits

[[Goldenfields]]: Endless plains of knee-high grass with pollen that glows at dawn and dusk, reflecting the hues of the sky. They hum in harmony when wind passes through them.

[[Crownwood Forests]]: Ancient, high-canopied trees with bark like obsidian and leaves like spun gold. Some are semi-sentient. It's said the oldest ones can dream.

[[The Horizon Spires]]: Jagged golden rock formations that jut from the planet’s crust like broken crowns. Pilgrims believe they mark where ancient celestial beings once knelt.

🌌 Skybloom Seasons: Once a year, an aurora of living spores rises from the ground and dances through the sky — a planetary exhale. This is the holiest time of year.

🌧 Living Storms: Rainclouds laced with emotion-sensitive electricity. Tech that operates during one may become "possessed" or altered.

Sentience & Spirit

Aurelya is semi-sentient, though not in the way artificial intelligence or human minds work. Its memory is vast, but not linear. It doesn’t speak, but it communicates — through dream, through feeling, through flora and fauna.

It remembers pain, especially where colonists have carved into its flesh. These scars bloom with black flowers — known as Gravemoss.

It responds to joy: A child’s laughter may cause a vine to bloom. A truthful song may part a path through a storm.

It rejects lies and cruelty: Those who come in greed or fear find themselves lost, unwelcome, or hunted by the very earth.

Inhabitants

🏕 Native Tribes and Nomads

The Lysari – Flower-walkers who live in harmony with pollen fields. Known for melodic speech and story-weaving dances.

The Ca’Ren – Nomadic riders of six-legged beasts called veltrons. Use no metal, only bone, wood, and sunlight-refined clay.

The Vereday – Seers and shamans who live atop the Horizon Spires. They claim to hear the dreams of the planet.

[[Lioranthros Solen - Character Profile| Lioranthros Solen]] — The Living Crown

Born beneath a canopy of golden leaves and wind-song, Lioranthros Solan, known simply as Lior, is a child of Aurelya in every way. The planet seems to know him, to respond to him — the grass bows beneath his feet, the trees hush when he sleeps, and the storms break gently around his laughter.

He was born during a Skybloom season, when golden spores filled the air and strange, distant voices whispered across worlds. On that night, moments of wonder and mystery unfolded for those who would one day become his guardians, mentors, and friends — each touched by a golden flicker they could not explain.

Though still young, Lior is already a symbol among his people. Not because he rules, but because he radiates the joy, resilience, and harmony Aurelya itself embodies. He is scarred from playing rough, never without a smile, and his long, dreaded hair dances in the breeze as he races with wild elk or naps beneath whispering branches.

He is not a prince. He is not a prophet.
He is something older, something lighter —
the child the land chose, and who chooses joy in return.



👦 Lior’s People

Lior’s village is unnamed by design — a small, tight-knit forest settlement that believes in balance, not ownership. They raise their children communally and live in root-grown homes shaped by the trees themselves. They live simply, guided by the seasons and stories, not technology or power.

Flora & Fauna

🦋 Lumino Moths – Wings like crystal, attracted to the sadness of children. Used in mourning rituals.

🦌 Cindertine Elk – Huge, antlered beasts that burn with golden mist when threatened.

🐍 Thornscale Serpents – Guardians of the underground. Will not strike unless lied to.

🌱 Whispershrubs – Shrubs that repeat the last kind thing they heard. Villagers plant them near graves.

🌼 Solaflare Bloom – A flower that blooms only when a person speaks their truest wish aloud.

Technology vs. Nature

Modern technology fails on Aurelya. Not instantly, but inevitably.

Hammerhead's terraforming engines corroded in days.

Survey drones return footage of things that weren't there when they left.

Military exo-suits have been found buried in vine-covered graves with no trace of the wearer.


Only tools made of natural materials, respectful of Aurelya’s pulse, function properly. This has shaped a culture of ritual craftsmanship, herbal science, and subtle energy manipulation rather than brute force tech.

Myths & Prophecy

The Living Crown – An old, quiet legend told by the Vereday:

> “One shall rise without throne, bearing laughter not law, and the land will bloom beneath his feet. The world will not know him as king… but it will bow in joy.”



The Sun Beneath the Soil – Some say Aurelya was once a dead world until a celestial seed fell from the sky, awakening the planet’s soul.

The Return of the Bloomwalker – A child who walked among the flowers before memory, and who will walk again in Aurelya’s time of need.
