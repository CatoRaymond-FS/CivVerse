🧩 Overview

The Novva Pilot Academy is Caelus' most prestigious flight institution, located near the upper layers of the [[The Forge Tiers]]. Known for its exacting standards, Novva doesn’t just train pilots — it creates navigators, troubleshooters, and tactical thinkers capable of surviving even the harshest orbital conditions.

Though built in a sector known for its industry, Novva is a shining technological beacon, blending flight theory, real-time simulations, and live orbital exercises. Its graduates are recognized system-wide.

🛠 Connection to the [[The Forge Tiers]]

The academy is powered by tech directly sourced from [[The Forge Tiers]]’ research and development cores.

Students often test-pilot experimental ships forged in the same layers as Caelus’ transit technology.

The relationship is symbiotic:

Novva trains future pilots to run advanced ships

The Forge gains real-world performance feedback from top-tier cadets

🧬 Structure & Culture

Students live in high-efficiency dorm units

Most training occurs in domed hangars suspended by gravity lifts near [[The Forge Tiers]]’ highest ring

Uniforms are streamlined, responsive, and linked to student ID profiles

The culture is competitive but deeply respectful — cadets are taught to support each other mid-flight, even if they’re rivals on the ground

🧑‍🏫 Notable Faculty & Roles

Dean Arvis Sella – Veteran of interplanetary conflict; believes emotional control is as vital as maneuvering skill

[[Luna - Character Profile|Luna]] (guest instructor) – Occasionally returns to mentor new pilots, especially those in advanced orbital navigation

[[Jace - Character Profile|Jace]] - Was expelled from the academy right before graduation

🔍 Reputation

Only 12% of applicants are accepted annually

Cadets who graduate are often fast-tracked into CTA, diplomatic courier teams, or private high-risk escort contracts

A quiet rumor persists that a few students are recruited directly into Caelus’ black ops exploratory program — though this is never confirmed publicly
