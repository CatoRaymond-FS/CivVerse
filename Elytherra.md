🕯️ Overview

Elytherra is a solemn, sun-scoured world where faith and silence rule. Its stone cities rise like sermons from the dust, and its people bow not out of fear—but because they were never taught to stand.

The planet lives beneath the weight of a vow made generations ago — a sacred silence, born of obedience, unity, and struggle. The Viridic Order claims the world was saved by a man named Virgil, whose teachings became law and whose disappearance became doctrine.

Now, the world waits — not for salvation, but for anyone brave enough to question the silence.

🛡️ Planetary Traits

🗡 The Woundplains – Barren valleys where ancient battles against “heresy” were fought. Wind howls through broken blades left standing like headstones.

🕍 Citadel-Cities – Towering walled cities ruled by clergy and knights. Homes of the Order’s elite. Law is scripture; doubt is crime.

⛪ The Crowned Vaults – Hidden chambers said to contain Virgil’s original teachings, sealed from the public. Few are allowed inside.

🛰 The Quiet Sky – Space traffic is tightly monitored. Only the Order’s port sees activity. Rumors of the stars are muffled before they echo.

📖 Heresy & The Prophecy

The Forbidden Rumor:
“A child born under a bright sky shall bring peace to all who come near him.”

Why It’s Dangerous:

Contradicts Virgil’s final teachings.

Suggests salvation might come again — or from outside the Order.


Order’s Response:

Suppression.

Execution without trial.

Propaganda blaming outsiders.


Cultural Impact:

Whispers in villages.

Murmurs among young knights.

The beginning of doubt.

🌆 Cities & Life

🏰 Citadel Monasteries – Stone-etched fortresses of learning and ritual. Libraries of censored texts. Training grounds for knights.

🏜 Outer Settlements – Humble villages built around water wells and chapel-towers. Life revolves around prayer, ration, and ritual labor.

🕯 Law & Justice –

Heresy is death.

Dissent is unthinkable.

To speak against the Order is to vanish.

🔥 Final Boss – The Silent Oath

> “The vow never broke. You did.”



A manifestation of the protagonist’s own faith taken too far.

A towering, silver knight — faceless, voiceless, flawless.

Wields the Crownblade, forged from the Knight’s forgotten promises.

Final choice: Strike and destroy the vow… or kneel and transcend it.
