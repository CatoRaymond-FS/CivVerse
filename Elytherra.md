The Viridic Order

A theocratic military empire rooted in faith, discipline, and control.

Founder: Virgil the Ascended, a messianic conqueror who vanished at the height of power.

Belief System:
“Salvation comes through obedience and struggle.”
Heresy is the highest sin — to doubt is to betray humanity’s only hope.


🔒 Control Mechanisms:

The Spaceport: Only connection to the stars, completely locked down by the Order.

Scripture & Surveillance: Ancient texts and modern tech used to keep control over faith, knowledge, and thought.

⚔️ The Knights of Elytherra

Sworn warriors of the Viridic Order.

Attire: Sun-blasted cloaks, energy-forged blades, armor embossed with religious glyphs.

Training: Raised from childhood in Citadel Monasteries.

Purpose:

Enforce the doctrine.

Purge heresy.

Undertake sacred pilgrimages.


Status: Revered, feared, and increasingly conflicted.

🔥 The Heresy

The Prophecy:
“A child born under a bright sky shall bring peace, and no sword shall strike near him.”

This contradicts Virgil’s doctrine of salvation through struggle.

The Order’s Response:

Ruthless suppression.

Execution of any who speak of the child.

Rewriting of scripture to erase the prophecy.


The Underground Believers:

Called the Unshackled.

Seek to spread word of the boy and fracture the Order’s control.

🌟 The Knight’s Journey

The Protagonist:
A young knight, trained in faith, now caught between loyalty and truth.
His name? TBD — but he is The Last to Take the Oath.

Inciting Moment:
A quiet moment during a cleansing mission — a heretic whispers, “The boy is real.”

Pilgrimage Arc:

Begins with devotion.

Encounters the broken, the outcast, the silenced.

Gradual realization that the prophecy might be real.

The silent vow he swore begins to crack.

🏙️ Cities & Culture

Citadel Strongholds: Towering religious-military cities carved into mountains or built on old world ruins.

Outer Villages: Dusty settlements under watch, filled with quiet devotion and whispered prayers.

Art & Architecture: Relic mosaics, stained-glass solar collectors, statues of Virgil’s “ascension.”

Law & Order:

Heresy = death.

Faith = survival.

All oaths are binding — until they break.

🛑 Potential Final Boss: The Silent Oath

> “A sword that remembers every vow… and all who broke them.”



A physical embodiment of every broken promise and corrupted prayer — possibly a former High Inquisitor bound to ancient tech.

Covered in fragments of shattered relics and forgotten names.

Speaks in whispers that echo the Knight’s own past doubts.
