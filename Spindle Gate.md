🧭 Overview

Spindle Gate is the primary spaceport and orbital logistics hub of [[Velthera]], responsible for outbound and inbound traffic across Caelus and beyond. Sleek, tightly monitored, and humming with quiet activity, it’s a place where precision is law, and silence covers truth.

On paper, it’s one of the safest, most advanced facilities on the planet.

Beneath the surface, unauthorized launches, black box pings, and "vanished" flight logs suggest not all vessels are on record.

⚙️ Infrastructure

Launch Spindles: Vertical grav-launch chambers that fire cargo and personnel pods into orbit. Reusable launch rails lined with magnetic amplifiers.

Orbital Tracking Deck: Dome-shaped control room that monitors all registered spaceflight paths — and filters suspicious activity to "Tier-2" clearance.

Hangar Stratum 4: Lower bay level where engineers and calibrators like [[Jace - Character Profile|Jace]] run final checks on freighter ships and skiffs.

Echo Docks: An older maintenance tier that’s supposedly decommissioned, yet receives encrypted access requests.

🧬 Culture & Activity

Workers wear CTA-coded uniforms with color tags denoting clearance.

Artificial gravity control and light schedules simulate planetary daylight.

Strict radio silence during launches, except in emergencies.

Calibrators and diagnostics techs often pass encrypted data via embedded tools — a quiet rebellion that the system ignores… until it can’t.

🛑 Secrets & Underlayers

Certain outbound ships leave with non-native energy signatures or without full cargo logs.

Unverified launch patterns match those of defunct exploratory vessels.

Jace is one of several low-tier calibrators suspected of leaking access codes — but no one’s caught him.

Rumors whisper of a backdoor passage to The Founding District, buried somewhere inside the Gate's deeper maintenance routes.
