🧭 Overview

The Surface Gate is the primary access point to the subterranean zones of [[Driath and Driath's End|Driath]], including the mines, machinery hubs, and labor stations where workers like [[Lyra - Character Profile|Lyra]] spend their days — or their lives.

Heavily rusted and fortified with aging auto-turrets and reinforced bulkheads, the Gate is equal parts symbol and scar — a barrier that separates what the city uses and what it discards.

🛠️ Visuals & Vibe

Covered in fading Hammerhead propaganda slogans like:

“Progress Digs Deep.”

“Work Builds Freedom.”

“Don’t Look Back. There’s Nothing There.”


Graffiti layers cover the base of the Gate — marked by protest tags, lost names, and old union signs now painted over in industrial red.

The checkpoint is staffed by bored guards and maintained by automated scanners that check gear tags and detect unauthorized tech.

🔐 Access & Control

Workers pass through in shifts — scanned, logged, and moved like cargo.

The wealthy and elite have never stepped through and view it only in stylized media.

Jess - [[Jess - Character Profile|Jess]] passes through daily without fully understanding what it represents — just a door between her and Lyra.
