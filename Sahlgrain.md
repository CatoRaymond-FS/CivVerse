🔥 Landscape & Climate

A harsh, dry world dominated by desert mesas, dusty plains, and sparse vegetation.

Scorching hot during the day, with hazy orange skies baking the land.

Crimson skies in the morning and evening paint the terrain blood-red, a haunting daily ritual.

Nights are pitch-black, with a small moon and few visible stars, leaving the land in near-total darkness.


🏙️ Towns & Life

Scattered homesteads and small settlements cling to survival.

Most towns are self-regulated with appointed sheriffs and deputies, trying to maintain law in a world teetering on the edge of chaos.

Centralized government is nonexistent or failed, and justice is delivered by the barrel or the badge.

Life here is hard and unsparing; reputation, marksmanship, and grit define your worth.

⚙️ Technology & Culture

Industrial steampunk era: everything runs on steam, pressure, and stubbornness.

CivFrames exist but are in early, experimental forms—no sleek chrome here:

Some resemble metal horses or autonomous wagons.

Others are tools for farming or home life, built from scrap and outdated blueprints.


Steam trains run between only a few remaining hubs, battered but vital.

Weapons include pressure-loaded rifles, steam-charged pistols, and customized gearwork arms—tools of both war and survival.


🧨 History & Decline

Once a vital trade hub, connected by rail and land routes, Sahlgrain was stripped bare by an offshoot of Hammerhead Industries seeking rare minerals and natural resources.

When they pulled out, they left the land scorched and unstable—the economy crashed, and many towns fell into ruin.

What remains are the survivors, who turned their back on corporate rule and now live by their own codes.
