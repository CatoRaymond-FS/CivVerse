“The Bonepile remembers. The Burn Yards don’t care.”




---

🏜️ Overview

The Burn Yards lie just beyond the controlled perimeter of [[Ferrun]], where the desert’s heat and radiation distort sight, sound, and memory. It’s a twisted stretch of scorched earth, shattered hulls, and frame wreckage too dangerous or corrupted to be brought into the main [[The Frame Bonepile]].

Here, malfunctioning reactors, partially active AI cores, and the warped remains of experimental CivFrames rot under both suns. Some say the sand there vibrates from residual energy. Others say it screams.

⚠️ Environment

Temperatures are extreme, spiking unpredictably due to radiation pockets and melting alloys

Electromagnetic interference scrambles sensors and destabilizes most frame power cells

Sandstorms frequently expose or bury valuable tech — or entire frame torsos

Some areas are said to warp sound, creating auditory hallucinations of old pilots


> “The worst part isn’t the heat. It’s the way the wind hums with things you forgot.”

💀 Purpose

Originally used as an overflow site for unprocessable frame wrecks

Now treated as a black zone: unregulated, unsanctioned, off-limits by Hammerhead policy

Sometimes used unofficially by:

Illicit salvagers

Outcast trainees attempting to “prove themselves”

Hammerhead engineers disposing of things they want forgotten

Sil Rennet, rarely, during night hours — to burn frame memory cores

🔩 Notable Features

The Meltfield: A fused glass-and-metal plain where multiple frame reactors ruptured. Walking it barefoot is an initiation among the reckless.

The Spire Jaws: Two protruding exosuit torsos half-buried and fused together — sometimes used as a landmark or shrine

“The Breather”: A half-buried experimental frame that sometimes vents steam, as if alive. Rhea once dared a sprint past it.

Pyre Tags: Salvagers leave metal ID tags tied in melted cables at the edge of the Yard — a warning to stay out.
