🔧 Overview

The Frame Bonepile is a massive, sun-scorched scrapyard located on the outskirts of [[Ferrun]], filled with the remains of broken, outdated, or failed CivFrames. It’s a harsh symbol of the city's unforgiving purpose — a reminder that failure under the suns earns no sympathy.

⚙️ Function

Scrapyard: All damaged or decommissioned frames end up here, stripped for parts or studied for faults.

Training Ground: Some mechanics-in-training are sent here to scavenge under pressure or rebuild systems in real-time.

Burial Ground: Operators who’ve died in the field are sometimes memorialized by tagging their old suits and leaving tokens or welded plates behind.

Black Market Site: At night, illicit scavengers and rogue tinkerers sometimes sneak in to harvest forbidden components — unstable cores, weapon nodes, banned software modules.

☀️ Environment & Danger

Daytime temperatures here are extreme, even by Ferrun standards — enough to warp alloys and bake suit exteriors.

Large frame torsos and limbs protrude from dunes like metal skeletons; some are still partially functional.

Magnetic disturbances and leftover power cores cause occasional sparks, noise interference, or “ghost” signals — drawing superstitions among locals.

🔩 Cultural Meaning

Veterans of Ferrun believe the Bonepile is a place of memory and lesson, not waste.

Dustshrines are sometimes set up along its edge — prayer knots, welded parts, or scratched names.

Some whisper that certain suits here still move or retain corrupted AI fragments, searching for their final command.
