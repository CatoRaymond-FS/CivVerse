Type: Unira is a full planet, but smaller than Earth—compact and heavily populated.  
  
Past Environment: Once a thriving jungle world, rich in life and biodiversity.  
  
Current State: Around 70% of the surface is urbanized or industrial. The remaining 30% includes oceans, mountain ranges, and scattered wild zones, though most are heavily regulated or inaccessible.  
  
Atmosphere: Clean in rural areas and upper-class zones. Hazy and polluted in industrial cities. In subterranean areas like Driath’s End, breathing equipment is often necessary.  
  
Light & Sky: The sun and two moons are visible from surface-level areas. Stars flicker faintly where pollution is thin. Deep underground, light is entirely artificial and often unreliable.  
  
Subsurface Phenomena: The deeper you go beneath the surface, the more unpredictable the world becomes. Equipment begins to malfunction. Readings become strange. Workers report hallucinations—visions of places, memories, or beings that may have never existed. These anomalies are unacknowledged by Hammerhead but whispered about among the workers.  
  
Space Travel: Space travel is possible and ongoing, but only for the wealthy elite and cargo transports. The majority of Unirans have no access to off-world life, and space is more myth than reality for most.
