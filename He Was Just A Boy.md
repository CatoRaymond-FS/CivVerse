The first time Auren saw the one who was chosen.


---

The sky had turned gold again.

It wasn't a storm, not like the one four years ago — not like the one they whispered about in tents and temple halls, their voices dropping whenever Auren walked past. This one was gentler. The kind of light that filtered through tall branches like it knew it wasn’t supposed to be there. It brushed the rocks with honey, soaked the soil in warmth.

Auren stepped from behind a cracked pillar, half-buried in vines. He had come to the forest’s edge chasing an echo — not a sound, but a feeling. Like something in the wind remembered his name.

And then he saw him.

A boy, younger than him, barefoot and laughing as he tried to catch floating specks of pollen. The light clung to him like it belonged there. His hair glowed where the sun touched it. His hands were outstretched. Free. Unburdened. A deer watched from the brush, unafraid.

He wasn't guarded. He wasn’t being followed by acolytes. He didn’t wear prophecy, or robes, or expectations stitched in ancient runes.

He was just… a boy.

Auren stood still. Not hidden, but unnoticed. He felt the weight of the totem in his hand — the one carved for him before he could speak. Its edges dug into his palm.

The boy paused, tilting his head like he’d heard something. For one moment, their eyes met through the soft haze of gold and green.

Lior smiled.

It was small. Honest. A child’s smile with no knowing behind it.

And then he turned and ran back toward the trees, calling for someone — his mother, maybe — the name lost in birdsong.

Auren stayed until the light dimmed. Until the air no longer shimmered.

He didn’t speak. He didn’t move.

And he didn’t cry.
