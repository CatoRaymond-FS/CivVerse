The Artery of [[Driath and Driath's End|Driath]]

> “Everything worth something moves through here — including the truth.”

🧭 Overview

The Freight Spine is a vast industrial transport corridor that snakes through the lower strata of [[Driath and Driath's End|Driath]], carrying refined minerals, dismantled machine parts, and anything else that Hammerhead finds profitable.

It’s a place of constant motion, filled with loading arms, magnetic cranes, drone lifters, and conveyor arteries that disappear into dark chasms.

🔩 Features

Massive hauler rails run north to south, connecting Driath’s mines to surface depots and off-world shipping towers.

Worker walkways run parallel — rusted, vibrating with the weight of what they carry.

Hidden compartments in older shafts are rumored to be used by smugglers, rogue tinkerers, or resistance elements.

📦 Atmosphere

Smells like oil, iron, and scorched stone.

Echoes carry from distant machinery — making it hard to tell if someone is nearby or far off.

Many workers avoid it on their breaks. Too loud. Too fast. Too impersonal.
