⚔️ Overview

Born into faith. Forged by silence. The Knight of Elytherra is a loyal sword to the Viridic Order — raised in walled stone, trained in the sacred arts of both scripture and war. He swore the Silent Oath without hesitation.

And yet… in his silence, something stirs.

When a forbidden rumor reaches him — of a child born under a bright sky, destined to bring peace — doubt takes root. A mission of obedience becomes a journey of disobedience. His pilgrimage becomes a rebellion. And his vow may yet be broken.

The Knight has no true name. The Order stripped it from him. But on his path, the world will remember him differently — as a voice in a land of silence.
