“In Ferrun, you don’t outrun the heat. You outlast it.”

🌞 Overview

Ferrun is a desert city on [[Unira]], located closer to the planet’s dual suns than any other settlement. It exists not out of comfort but necessity — built around the deployment, maintenance, and stress-testing of CivFrames in extreme conditions. The city is a proving ground, a forge for man and machine alike.


---

🛠️ Purpose

Ferrun’s core function is to support field operations, endurance testing, and repair of CivFrames under brutal environmental pressure.

Frames are tested for heat resistance, power stability, and external damage in real combat simulations

Ferrun is considered a “burning crucible” by Hammerhead — where only the most reliable tech and strongest operators survive

There are whispers that some experimental or unstable Frames are also dumped here for real-world stress tests — without public knowledge

🏗️ City Layout & Architecture

The city is composed of individual domed shelters, each designed to resist dust, solar radiation, and searing heat

Domes are clustered into zones: Residential, Mechanized Yards, Field Training Grounds, and Frame Bunkers

Most movement outdoors requires protective suits or CivFrames — surface exposure without protection can cause heatstroke in minutes

Utility corridors run beneath the surface for water transport and cooling infrastructure



---

🧍‍♂️ Culture & People

Ferrun’s people are hardened and sun-scarred — resilience is their language

Clothing is light, breathable, and wrapped for protection; most wear hoods, face wraps, and tinted visors

Dark-skinned and multi-toned populations dominate, evolved or adapted for life under the dual suns

Status is earned by endurance, skill with Frames, or time survived — not by wealth

Children are taught basic Frame repair and heat survival by age 10

🔥 Notable Locations

[[The Burn Yards]] – Outdoor testing zones for experimental suits. Most scorched, some still smoking

[[The Frame Bonepile]] – A scrapyard filled with failed or damaged CivFrame units, used for salvage
