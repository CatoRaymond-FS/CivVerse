🏗️ Overview

The Forge Tiers are a multi-layered vertical industrial complex and research zone within [[Caelus]], where innovation meets infrastructure. Each tier specializes in advanced manufacturing, energy development, robotics, and experimental shipbuilding. Despite being heavily automated, thousands of engineers, AI specialists, and calibrators live and work here.

The Forge powers not just Caelus, but many of its orbital satellites, docking stations, and even deep-space expeditions.

🛠 Purpose & Structure

Originally a vertical shipyard, the Forge has grown into a self-contained engineering megastructure

Lower tiers handle raw material refinement and bulk cargo processing

Middle tiers support experimental fabrication, flight testing, and ship diagnostics

Upper tiers serve as headquarters for tech corporations and research labs — including the elite [[Novva Pilot Academy]]

🔧 Key Facilities

The Calibration Spine – Long scaffolding corridors where AI specialists and systems techs work alongside drone labor

Forge Vent Stack 07 – A heavily secured lab where early prototype suits and frames are tested

The Coilworks – A hazardous magneto-lab rumored to be blacklisted after an energy instability event

Tier 9 Transit Hub – Links the Forge to [[Spindle Gate]] via secured cargo elevators and pressurized rail

🧬 Culture & Work Life

Most Forge workers live in narrow dorm corridors built along support beams

Jobs range from AI tuning, plasma weld control, to orbital material research

Security is tight due to corporate espionage and the value of the Forge's R&D

Cafeterias are nutrient-optimized, but black market food hubs have emerged in “drift corners” — overlooked ventilation zones

Sectors operate 24/7 in shift rotations — the Forge never sleeps
