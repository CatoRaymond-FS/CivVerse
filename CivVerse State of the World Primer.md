🌌 Overview

The CivVerse is a fractured but deeply interconnected system of planets, cultures, and ideologies. Worlds vary greatly in class divide, technology, and political alignment. While some, like [[Caelus - World Document|Caelus]], uphold ideals of order, others like [[Unira - World Document|Unira]] struggle beneath the weight of exploitation.

Much of the galaxy’s development stems from the use and misuse of [[CivFrame Theory]], and its practical application through the Frames that bear its name.

📜 Timeline (Abbreviated)

~400 Years Ago – First interplanetary colonization efforts.

~300 Years Ago – Formation of the Caelus Ideal Accord.

~200 Years Ago – Rise of industrialization on Unira; resource extraction begins.

~150 Years Ago – CivFrame Theory developed in [[The Radiant Assembly]].

~100 Years Ago – Hammerhead Engineering rises to prominence on Unira.

~30 Years Ago – [[R.C. Faye - Character Profile|Dr. R.C. Faye]] publishes early drafts of Frame integration philosophy.

Present Day – Tensions rise as planets diverge further in technological, philosophical, and social paths.

🗺️ Power Map

Unira

Controlled largely by [[Hammerhead Engineering and Manufacturing]].

[[Driath and Driath's End|Driath]] is a mega-city and industrial hub.

Security and governance are merged—Hammerhead's interests are law.

CivFrames are essential and integrated into society from top to bottom.


Caelus

Led by the Caelus Technocratic Authority (CTA).

Space travel, data control, and education are state-prioritized.

Sectors like [[The Radiant Assembly]] and [[Vault Primaris]] control law, history, and science.

Civilian life is secure, monitored, and advanced—but lacks awareness of the suffering elsewhere.

🛰️ Technology & Advancement

Tiered Access

Prototype (unstable, experimental)

Civilian (consumer-grade, affordable or inherited)

Industrial (used by specialists or corporations)

Military (restricted to enforcement or state control)


Unira: Handmade, patched together, often retrofitted to work under duress.
Caelus: Sleek, streamlined, and integrated into architecture and culture.

🚚 Travel and Transit

Ground & Local

Rails: Main method of mass movement across cities like [[Driath and Driath's End|Driath]]

Crawlers: Slow, heavily armored industrial haulers

Bikes: Common among lower classes for fast city traversal

Hovercraft / Airships: Found on Caelus and other advanced planets


Interplanetary

Cargo Freighters: Industrial ships for material transport

Passenger Vessels: More common on Caelus; tightly monitored on Unira

Personal Ships: Rare and expensive, often privately owned


Ports & Policy

[[Erza Venn - Character Profile|Erza Venn]] and others rely on independent ports like the [[Frame Bonepile]].

Hammerhead-controlled ports dominate Unira

Government and privatized docks are standard on Caelus

Travel requires ID, cargo manifest, clearance codes, and formal documentation

⚖️ Law & Order

Unira: Enforced by Hammerhead Security, who act as military, police, and corporate oversight. Brutal, direct, and dismissive of public well-being.

Caelus: Overseen by privatized security firms and autonomous drone enforcers under the CTA. Controlled but quieter; surveillance is the main deterrent.


Justice on both worlds favors power and position—but Caelus keeps the illusion of neutrality while Unira has no need to hide its imbalance.
