Summary:
The Goldenfields are a breathtaking expanse of knee-high grasslands located near the heart of Aurelya, often considered the soul of the planet itself. The fields stretch beyond the horizon in all directions, blanketed in golden and amber grasses that shimmer with life and light. They are one of the oldest known natural places on Aurelya sacred, sentient, and subtly alive.

Visuals:
At dawn and dusk, the grass releases a glowing pollen that floats like tiny lanterns in the breeze. These particles catch the light of the sun and sky, reflecting hues of soft rose, indigo, gold, and sapphire. At twilight, the fields appear as a sea of slow-burning starlight, gently swaying to an unseen rhythm.

Soundscape:
When the wind moves through the plains, the Goldenfields hum. Not in discord — but in subtle harmony. The sound is almost choral, with layers of tones that can resemble soft flutes or a distant choir. Travelers say it sings to the soul, and many who walk there alone come out changed.

Lore & Significance:

Birthplace of the Crown: This is believed to be the place where The Living Crown, [[Lioranthros Solen - Character Profile|Lior]], first walked barefoot into the world, laughing as the grasses shimmered around him.

Time Feels Different: Some say that time slows or even bends in the fields. Memories resurface. Wounds — both physical and emotional — are soothed.

Guarded, Yet Open: Though Aurelya resists colonization, Goldenfields welcomes the gentle-hearted. The land itself seems to guide travelers, especially children and the lost.


Local Flora & Fauna:

Glintgrass: The dominant plant, whose golden blades carry the glowing pollen.

Driftwings: Delicate, glowing butterfly-like creatures that live among the pollen and only emerge during dusk.

Thrumroots: Deep-rooted plants that create harmonic resonance with wind and footsteps, contributing to the field’s hum.


Encounters:

Children have reported seeing a boy dancing alone in the pollen — laughing, glowing, and sometimes walking just above the ground.

Some adults claim to glimpse moments from their past hidden in the pollen's light.

Others, like R.C. Faye, have simply come to sit, to feel, and to remember.


Tone:
Goldenfields feels like a memory wrapped in sunlight. It is not just a place, but a feeling — of peace, hope, and reverence. It asks for silence and gives clarity in return.
